### What I have learned

##### 2015 01 05 
- Have to make `pakage.json` manually or `npm init` - in the project folder
- If want to not only download dependency library but also add to `package.json`, add `--save` option like... `npm install express --save`
- Want to prevent to deploy to production, `npm install lodash --save-dev`
- Can revive `/node_modules` folder, if you have `package.json`. command is `npm install`
- Want to exclude dev libraries, do `npm install --production`
